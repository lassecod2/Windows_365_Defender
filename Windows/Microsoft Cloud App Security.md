## The Cloud App Security framework

-   **Discover and control the use of Shadow IT**: Identify the cloud apps, IaaS, and PaaS services used by your organization. Investigate usage patterns, assess the risk levels and business readiness of more than 16,000 SaaS apps against more than 80 risks. Start managing them to ensure security and compliance.
    
-   **Protect your sensitive information anywhere in the cloud**: Understand, classify, and protect the exposure of sensitive information at rest. Leverage out-of-the box policies and automated processes to apply controls in real-time across all your cloud apps.
    
-   **Protect against cyberthreats and anomalies**: Detect unusual behavior across cloud apps to identify ransomware, compromised users or rogue applications, analyze high-risk usage and remediate automatically to limit the risk to your organization.
    
-   **Assess the compliance of your cloud apps**: Assess if your cloud apps meet relevant compliance requirements including regulatory compliance and industry standards. Prevent data leaks to non-compliant apps, and limit access to regulated data.

## Architecture

Cloud App Security integrates visibility with your cloud by:

-   Using Cloud Discovery to map and identify your cloud environment and the cloud apps your organization is using.
-   Sanctioning and unsanctioning apps in your cloud.
-   Using easy-to-deploy app connectors that take advantage of provider APIs, for visibility and governance of apps that you connect to.
-   Using Conditional Access App Control protection to get real-time visibility and control over access and activities within your cloud apps.
-   Helping you have continuous control by setting, and then continually fine-tuning, policies.
