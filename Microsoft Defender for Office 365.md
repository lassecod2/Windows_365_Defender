## Defender for Office 365 Policies

The policies that are defined for your organization determine the behavior and protection level for predefined threats. Policy options are extremely flexible. For example, your organization's security team can set fine-grained threat protection at the user, organization, recipient, and domain level. It is important to review your policies regularly because new threats and challenges emerge daily.

-   **[Safe Attachments](https://docs.microsoft.com/da-dk/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments?view=o365-worldwide)**: Provides zero-day protection to safeguard your messaging system, by checking email attachments for malicious content. It routes all messages and attachments that do not have a virus/malware signature to a special environment, and then uses machine learning and analysis techniques to detect malicious intent. If no suspicious activity is found, the message is forwarded to the mailbox. To learn more, see [Set up Safe Attachments policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/da-dk/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/set-up-safe-attachments-policies?view=o365-worldwide).

Protection is ongoing and applies across your messaging and Office environment. Links are scanned for each click: safe links remain accessible and malicious links are dynamically blocked. To learn more, see [Set up Safe Links policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/da-dk/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/set-up-safe-links-policies?view=o365-worldwide).
